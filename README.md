# LLM Compiler Optimizer

## Moto of this Project

The main goal of this project is to create a more efficient and powerful LLM-based agent. It does this by using a **"compiler-like" approach** to optimize the agent's plan for fulfilling a user's request. This allows the agent to handle complex tasks that require multiple tools and steps.

## Architecture

The agent's architecture is based on a **state graph**, where each node in the graph represents a specific stage in the process of handling a user's request. The main components of this architecture are:

- **Router:**  
  The router is the entry point of the graph. It analyzes the user's query and decides whether to route it to the planner for complex tasks or to a response node for simple conversational replies.

- **Planner:**  
  The planner is responsible for creating a step-by-step plan to fulfill the user's request. It uses a large language model (LLM) to break down the task into a series of smaller, manageable steps that can be executed by the available tools.

- **Executor:**  
  The executor takes the plan created by the planner and executes each step. It calls the necessary tools with the specified arguments and collects the results.

- **Joiner:**  
  The joiner consolidates the results from the executed steps and decides on the next action. It can either send the final response to the user or, if the initial plan failed or needs to be adjusted, it can re-plan and send a new set of tasks to the executor.

- **Tools:**  
  The agent has access to a set of tools that it can use to perform specific tasks, such as searching the web or performing mathematical calculations.

## How it Works

The agent processes a user's request in the following steps:

1. **Routing:**  
   When the user sends a query, it is first processed by the router. The router determines if the query is a simple conversational question or a complex task that requires the use of tools.

2. **Planning:**  
   If the query is a complex task, it is sent to the planner. The planner creates a detailed, step-by-step plan to address the query. This plan is represented as a series of tasks, where each task consists of a tool to be called and the arguments to be passed to it.

3. **Execution:**  
   The plan is then passed to the executor, which executes each task in the plan. The executor calls the appropriate tools and collects the results.

4. **Joining and Responding:**  
   The results of the execution are sent to the joiner. The joiner analyzes the results and decides if the task is complete. If it is, the joiner generates a final response and sends it to the user. If the task is not complete, or if an error occurred during the execution, the joiner can trigger a re-planning phase, where a new plan is created to address the issue.

## How it Solves the Problem

This architecture helps to create more robust and efficient LLM agents in several ways:

- **Modularity:**  
  By breaking down the agent's logic into smaller, independent components, the architecture makes it easier to develop, debug, and maintain the agent.

- **Flexibility:**  
  The use of a state graph allows for a flexible and dynamic execution flow. The agent can loop back to the planning stage if the initial plan fails, allowing it to recover from errors and adapt to unexpected situations.

- **Optimization:**  
  The "compiler-like" approach to planning allows the agent to optimize its plan before execution. This can lead to more efficient and cost-effective use of the available tools and resources.

- **Extensibility:**  
  The architecture makes it easy to add new tools and capabilities to the agent. By simply defining a new tool and adding it to the list of available tools, the agent can immediately start using it in its plans.
